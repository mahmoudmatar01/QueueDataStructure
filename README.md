# FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Data Structure

A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure is a common way to manage a collection of elements where the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be processed. In this README, we'll discuss the basic concepts of a FIFO data structure, including its operations and characteristics.

## Introduction

In a FIFO data structure, elements are stored in a sequential order, and new elements are always added at the end of the queue. The core principle is that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be processed. This makes it suitable for scenarios where you want to process items in the order they were received, like managing a print queue, processing tasks, or handling requests in a web server.

## Operations

### Enqueue

The insert operation in a FIFO data structure is called "enqueue." When you enqueue a new element, it is added to the end of the queue, extending the queue's length. This operation ensures that the newly added element becomes the last in line for processing.

### Dequeue

The delete operation in a FIFO data structure is called "dequeue." When you dequeue an element, you remove the first element from the front of the queue. This is the element that was initially added to the queue and has been waiting the longest for processing. Dequeuing ensures that elements are processed in the order they were added.

## Illustration

In the provided illustration, you can see a simple representation of a FIFO queue. Elements are added to the right end (enqueue), and when you want to process an element, you remove it from the left end (dequeue). This action maintains the FIFO property.

## Usage

FIFO data structures have various practical applications in computer science and everyday life. Some common examples include:

- Print queues in computer systems, where documents are printed in the order they were sent to the printer.
- Task scheduling in operating systems, ensuring tasks are executed in the order they were requested.
- Web server request handling, processing incoming HTTP requests in the order they arrive.
- Breadth-first search in graph algorithms, exploring nodes level by level.

Understanding the fundamentals of FIFO data structures is essential when working with such applications, as it ensures that items are processed in a fair and orderly manner.
